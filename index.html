                    <h1>Placeholders? The When and How.</h1>
                    <p>Creativity is a fuel, the more we use it the more we need downtime to refuel. Like writers block or artists block, creativity is a finite mental resource that occasionally runs out. Enter placeholders! A tool that can be used to supplement creativity while working until a final determination is necessary. Figuring out what images or text to fill parts of a website that is under development with can cause fustration and break mental focus. However, there are many useful tools out there to create temporary placeholders meant just for this!</p>
                    <p>Images come in may shapes and sizes. To test working with images the website <a href="https://placehold.co/">Placehold.co</a> generates and provides links to images with dynamic sizes and colors. Even better, the image can be generated directly from the website URL. This allows placeholder images to be 'created' directly in an HTML images src tag.</p>
                    <p>While formatting this page, I needed temporary text to fill this section. The solution? Lorum Ipsum. Lorum Ipsum text generated from <a href="https://loremipsum.io/">Loremipsum.io</a> is a specified length of  gibberish that at a glance looks like english. This is extremeley usefull for padding out large sections of text, allowing me to get an idea for what this section would look like before even thinking about writing it. </p>
                    <p>Tools such as these allow people who struggle with the creativity in design to focus on the core structure of their task. For me, this provides the opportunity to draft the layout and design of a webpage without worrying about the contents! I decided to dedicate this page to these tools as they have been and will continue to be useful in drafting website UI for specific sites that have a designated topic!</p>
